# Data Mining & Machine Learning 2 Project

## Sentiment Analysis of Hotel Reviews using Deep Learning
### In this Project, my team mates and I carry out a Sentiment Analysis, which aims at classifying sentiment polarity into positive or negative sentiment. Deep Learning methods such as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model have been used to carry out the sentiment classification. Additionally, we will compare the performance of these two models and make a promising choice of model for sentiment classification.
