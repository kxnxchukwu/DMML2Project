 s Gravesandestraat 55 Oost 1092 AA Amsterdam Netherlands,194,08-03-2017,7.7,Hotel Arena, Russia , I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,397,1403,,11,7,2.9,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Couple ', ' Duplex Double Room ', ' Stayed 6 nights ']",0 days,52.3605759,4.9159683,0

1 3 Queens Garden Westminster Borough London W2 3BA United Kingdom,1058,2/16/2016,7.7,The Park Grand London Paddington, Saudi Arabia , To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful ,360,4380,,0,1,3.3,"[' Leisure trip ', ' Solo traveler ', ' Compact Double Room ', ' Stayed 4 nights ']",534 day,51.5142184,-0.1809032,0

,,,,,, Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,,No Positive,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Well located if you don t mind taking the train ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, This is my second time staying at this Hotel The first time I was on business This time it was for mini holiday The bed is very comfortable The room and bathroom very clean and spacious The location is very convenient Very good selection at breakfast ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, location not too bad access to tube and rail confusing with another hotel in group within close proximity went to book into wrong hotel interior bit tired and then we were in the room at the top of the building so bit dark Bathroom facilities strange with wet room set up but not ideal with curtain and door so close ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The space is good for a family of 4 The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The hotel location is excellent It is super close to the Paddington train and tube stations It is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy You walk three streets south and you are next to the Hyde Park Kensington Gardens gate I had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items My room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, Short walk from Kensington Gardens and Paddington Station Lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity Helpful friendly staff at reception Especially the lady from Armenia Was first put into a small rooftop room but then given a bigger room on lower floor with huge ceilings ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,,No Positive,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, The friendliness of the staff was exceptional They wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was 6 months pregnant received special treatment Breakfast was very good ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The bed is super comfortable I could close the curtains and make it very dark make tea in the morning in teapot there And of course it is very clean ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, Room was lovely and extremelly quiet especially after 11pm you can keep you window wide open and wont hear a sound They gave us a smartphone for free to use while we stay there was free 4g internet and free calls over the Europe and North America it helped alot to keep in touch with a family and dont get lost in Paris Staff was really nice stayed proffessional even after asking some silly questions like how the light turns on because we didnt knew that you need your room card to turn it on It is litterally 5minutes from Arc de Triopmhe which lights up wounderfully at the night and even you can pay 10 euro to get on top of it and you can see a Paris from there its absolutely beutiful Metro station is nearby which speeded up our travel instead of walking we took metro a ticket is about 2euro but it can bring you anywhere Really nice location highly recommended ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, Hotel Russell is my preferred hotel in London The Piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel Russell station and then you are in the central part of London close to the British Museum and many historic sites The hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations The only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, I highly recommend this hotel Excellent value for money in central London The architecture and the decor is remarkable My room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows And the bed was very comfortable In addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the Hotel Manager And it was great to see the Receptionist Cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, An incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room And Cohen the Receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite Excellent hotel ,,,,,,,,,,,1
,,,,,, The hotel is clean The staff is very friendly The room was relatively big so I had space to move around The staff is super friendly and the Location is perfect The tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus For example you might think that being close to Kings Cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least 10 minutes and that s if you get the exit right Switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location It s also located in front of Russel Square Park which is very nice ,,,,,,,,,,,1

,,,,,, Travelling to London was stressful as I had never driven into London before however it was not as difficult as I had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of 45 however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport The hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience I would recommend the last floor 14th the views were fantastic from the balcony The staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a 10 minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive I can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good The sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip The london Eye Parliarment Big Ben London Dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone ,,,,,,,,,,,1
